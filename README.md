## Introduction

"This repository contains a series of Java and JavaFX🖼 projects that were completed during the second semester of university🏢. The projects are related to each other and build upon one another.
The first project is a console application that reads questions from a file📑 and presents them as multiple choice and open-ended questions. 
The second project is a GUI version of the first project, implemented using JavaFX. This project, called Kahoot, features a visually appealing interface with music, pictures, and buttons for answering questions. It also reads questions from a file and presents them in a quiz format.📊
The third project builds upon the first two by adding multithreading and networking capabilities. It consists of a server-side application that starts the quiz and a client-side application that allows users to join and play the quiz. At the end of the quiz, the results are displayed.

Overall, these projects demonstrate a strong understanding of Java and JavaFX programming, as well as advanced concepts such as multithreading and networking."
